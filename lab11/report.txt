I had some difficulties due to my interrupt handler for uart. This was becaus I didn't assign the 
dequeue value to the character that was intended to be pushed. Once i fixed this issue, I was able
to reformat my card and play audio pretty easily. I though I was supposed to configure the sample 
rate for the device, but this didn't seem to have to be done. 
I learned all about dac/dma by reading through their documentation and configurable parameters within
those. I now know about generating sounds with the DAC, may be useful in the future.

1) The peripheral base address is which device we are configuring DMA to work with. This points
to the SPI interface.

2) This is necessary so that we can advance the section of data that we're reading with DMA. 
Without the increment, the base address would stay static and once we reached the end of the
buffer, we would return to the initial position and probably read the same data.

3) We have to wait for the memory transfer to complete before terminating the function.

4) The spi protocol can take care of 4 bytes by itself, we would not get anything out of 
using DMA for this.

5) This is so that audio intended to be played at the moment will not be overwritten by DMA.
If this were to happen, we would not get the intended audio, likely a garbled mess.
